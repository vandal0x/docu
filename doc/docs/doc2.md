# FAQ 2

## :globe_with_meridians: General

#### What is Noox?
Noox is a platform for Web3 users to mint badges based on on-chain actions. These badges will be soulbound NFTs that cannot be transferred. In this way, the NFTs that people own are unique identifiers, and will be used as their on-chain identity to unlock new opportunities.

## :crown: Badge

#### On which chain is the badge issued?

Each badge is an NFT on Ethereum Mainnet.
<br class="in" />

#### I have completed Task A but the badge is not claimable.

See if you have interacted with the contracts and actions listed on the badge details page. If you are not eligible after checking, please report it to the Bug Report channel in our Discord server.
<br class="in" />

#### How long does it take to check the badge eligibility?

Most will complete in 5 seconds or less, but it can take up to 60 seconds. You can close the modal while the eligibility check is being processed.
<br class="in" />

#### How long does it take to claim my badge?

By claiming a badge on Noox, you actually earn NFTs on Ethereum. The process of minting badges will take approximately 1~2 block heights(15~30 seconds).
<br class="in" />

#### I'm trying to transfer my badge to another EOA and it's not working, why is that?

Badges are minted as soulbound NFTs (ERC-1155) that are non-transferable.
<br class="in" />

#### Is there an additional fee other than gas fee when claiming badges?

There will be a charge of 0.005 ETH per badge.
<br class="in" />

#### Is there a place where I can view my badges?

Noox badges are NFTs and thus can be displayed by any interface supporting common NFT standards.
<br class="in" />

#### Can anyone create a new Noox badge?

You cannot create badges during beta. However, you’ll be able to create badges once the protocol is live in the near future.
<br class="in" />

#### Badge suggestion

The following channels are where you can suggest badges if you want them listed on Noox:
  - #suggest-new-badges channel in [Discord](http://discord.gg/noox)

## :key: Access

#### How do I access Noox?

You must hold “Noox Awakens” Round POAPs or Genesis Pass NFT to access our CBT.
<br class="in" />

#### I participated in Noox Awakens, but I haven’t yet claimed a POAP.

After April 30th, you will not be able to claim your POAP. If you do not claim the POAP within this period, early access to participate in our beta will be forfeited and you won't be able to receive any airdrop benefits.
<br class="in" />

#### Can I participate in CBT if I purchase a pass or POAP on the secondary market?

An access token is no longer required once you've created a profile. Transferring token to someone after creating a profile will not qualify for an airdrop as the snapshot will be taken at the end of the CBT.
<br class="in" />

#### When will Noox be open to the public?

Between the CBT and the public beta, there may be a short break of about 1~2 weeks.

## :money_with_wings: Airdrop and Rewards

#### How much is the allocation?

0.45% of the total token supply is allocated to Noox Awakeners. 0.5% of the total token supply is allocated to CBT.
<br class="in" />

#### What is Claim-to-Earn?

0.5% of the total token supply is allocated to CBT, and the tokens will be distributed based on the number of badges claimed by the user. 

For example, if a total of 100 badges were claimed during the 1st epoch and if you claimed 10 badges, then you are eligible to receive 10% of tokens distributed for that epoch. The more badges you claim, the more tokens you are eligible to receive.
<br class="in" />

#### How do I know If I’m eligible for Claim-to-Earn rewards?

We will share an epoch-by-epoch report on the number of tokens you can earn based on the number of badges you claimed for that epoch.
<br class="in" />

#### Wen Airdrop?

The snapshot will be taken towards the end of the CBT. You’ll be able to claim $preNOOX at the end of CBT. $PreNOOX tokens are temporary tokens to be swapped for $NOOX at an 1:1 ratio once the protocol is live in the near future.
<br class="in" />

#### Can I still receive airdrops if I hold POAP but do not participate in CBT?
Yes, each POAP guarantees the benefit of receiving a certain amount of airdrop. But, you won’t be able to receive rewards that can be earned through Claim-to-Earn.
<br class="in" />

#### Will POAPs purchased on secondary markets qualify for airdrops?
POAPs purchased on secondary markets before the snapshot are eligible for airdrops.
